Sure! Here are detailed notes on Classes and Objects in Java:

1. Introduction to Classes and Objects :

Class: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.
Object: An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with state and behavior defined by its class.

2. Structure of a Class
 => A class in Java typically consists of:

 . Fields (Attributes): Variables that hold the state of an object.
 . Methods (Behaviors): Functions that define the behavior of the objects created from the class.
 . Constructors: Special methods used to initialize objects.

3. Defining a Class:

Syntax:

 public class ClassName {
      // Fields
      dataType fieldName;
      // Constructor
      public ClassName(parameters) {
          // Initialization code
      }
      // Methods
      returnType methodName(parameters) {
          // Method body
      }
  }
  

Example:

  public class Car {
      // Fields
      String color;
      int speed;
      // Constructor
      public Car(String color, int speed) {
          this.color = color;
          this.speed = speed;
      }
      // Method
      public void drive() {
          System.out.println("The " + color + " car is driving at " + speed + " km/h.");
      }
  }
  


4. Creating Objects
Objects are created using the new keyword followed by the class constructor.

Syntax:

  . ClassName objectName = new ClassName(arguments);

Example:
  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Car myCar = new Car("Red", 100); // Creating an object of Car
          myCar.drive(); // Calling the method
      }
  }
  

5. Accessing Fields and Methods
You can access the fields and methods of an object using the dot (.) operator.

Example:
myCar.color = "Blue"; // Accessing and modifying a field
myCar.drive(); // Calling a method

6. Constructors:

. A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated.

. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type.

= Types of Constructors:

  . Default Constructor: A constructor with no parameters.
  . Parameterized Constructor: A constructor that takes parameters to initialize fields.

Example:

public class Bike {
    String brand;
    int gear;

    // Default Constructor
    public Bike() {
        brand = "Default Brand";
        gear = 1;
    }

    // Parameterized Constructor
    public Bike(String brand, int gear) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.gear = gear;
    }
}

7. The this Keyword : 
  . The this keyword refers to the current object instance.

  . It is used to differentiate between class fields and parameters with the same name.

Example:

public class Person {
    String name;

    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name; // 'this.name' refers to the class field
    }
}

8. Class vs. Object

 Class:
   . Blueprint for creating objects.
   . Defines properties and behaviors.
   . Can contain static members (fields and methods).

 Object:
  . Instance of a class.
  . Has its own state and behavior.
  . Created using the class constructor.


9. Static Members:-
  . Static Fields: Shared among all instances of a class. They belong to the class rather than any specific object.
  . Static Methods: Can be called without creating an instance of the class.

Example:

public class Counter {
    static int count = 0; // Static field

    public Counter() {
        count++; // Increment count for each object created
    }

    public static void displayCount() {
        System.out.println("Count: " + count);
    }
}

10. Summary
  . Classes and objects are fundamental concepts in Java OOP.
  . A class defines the structure and behavior of objects.
  . Objects are instances of classes that hold specific data and can perform actions.
  . Constructors are used to initialize objects, and the this keyword helps in referencing the current object.
